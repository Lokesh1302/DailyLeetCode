# The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is:

# S = (N / 2) * (A1 + An)

# where:

# S is the sum of the series.
# N is the number of terms in the series.
# A1 is the first term of the series.
# An is the last term of the series.


# Given mid as the midpoint:

# For LEFT SUM =

# N = mid âˆ’ 1 (number of terms)
# A1 = 1 (first term)
# An = mid - 1 (last term)


# For RIGHT SUM =

# N = n - (mid + 1) + 1  = n - mid (number of terms)
# A1 = mid + 1 (first term)
# An = N (last term)
